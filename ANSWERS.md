Explain the difference between `Relational Databases` and `SQL`.
- Relational databases store data in a table formed from rows and columns. SQL is a language that manages databases and, more specifically, querying data within.

Why do tables need a `primary key`?
- They uniquely identify each row.

What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key on another table.
- Foreign key

What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two tables.
- An  intermediary/bridge table to uniquely combine keys from differing tables.
